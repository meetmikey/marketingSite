<h1 class="page-title">Privacy Policy</h1>


<h2>Welcome to Mikey</h2>

Mikey is a browser extension and cloud service made by Sidekick Labs, Inc. (“Sidekick Labs”, “we”, “us”, “our”). Mikey helps you manage your Gmail, and in order to provide you with that service, we need to collect and store some of your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we do that. Terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service.

When using Mikey, you agree to our collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described here. If you have any questions or comments about our policy, you can contact us at privacy@mikeyteam.com.

<h2>What sort of information do we collect?</h2>

<h3>Information you provide us</h3>
We collect your email address first name and last name when you register for Mikey or if you correspond with us, like your first and last name, email address or phone number. If you email us, we may keep your message and contact information so we can respond to your request. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you with Mikey’s features and functionality.

<h3>Email</h3>
Mikey is designed to help you manage your Gmail account. When you link your Gmail account to Mikey, you give Mikey permission to securely access your information contained in or associated with those accounts. While Mikey does not store your password to these email accounts, the service does securely store emails as well as the files and links contained within them in order to allow you to find them as quickly and easily as possible.

<h3>Customer Testimonials</h3>
We obtain customer testimonials on our web site from public sources, which may contain personally identifiable information. To request removal of your personal information, contact us at privacy@mikeyteam.com.

<h3>Social Media</h3>
The Mikey website includes links to third party social media sites like Twitter. These links may collect your IP address and may set a cookie to enable the social media feature to function properly. These features are hosted by a third party and your interactions are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them. We have no control over the privacy practices of any third party social media sites.

<h3>Communications</h3>
We may use the information we collect or receive to communicate with you directly. For example, you may receive emails from us containing company updates, promotions, marketing, or special offers. We may also keep track of how you interact with links in these messages. We do this to be sure our communications and our products get better over time. If you’d rather not receive these emails, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication or by emailing us at privacy@mikeyteam.com. We also use your information to send you Mikey-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features, technical and security notices) – these Mikey-related communications are important, so you cannot opt out.

<h3>Analytics</h3>
We use web analytics software to measure traffic and usage trends and to help us better understand the functionality of Mikey in your Gmail. The web tools collect information sent by your browser, including the how you interact with your Gmail and other information that assists us in improving Mikey. The browser extension may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within Mikey, aggregated usage, and performance data. We use this information only to administer, improve, monitor and analyze the use of Mikey.

<h3>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>
If your information changes, or if you wish to discontinue use of Mikey, you may update or delete it by visiting your account settings within the extension or by emailing us at the email address listed below. In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law. If you have questions on how to change or delete your information, please contact privacy@mikeyteam.com. We will respond to your access request and wipe all data within 72 hours.

<h3>Data Retention</h3>
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at the email address listed above.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

<h2>Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
We will never share, rent or sell your information to third parties outside Sidekick Labs and its group companies (including subsidiaries and affiliates) without your consent, except as noted below:

<b>Information you share with others:</b> Mikey lets you share information with others, for example, through emails. Remember that when you share information via email, the recipient or recipients are responsible for keeping it private and respecting whatever intellectual property you have in that information.

<b>Service Providers:</b> We engage third-party business partners to provide you with Mikey and to perform functions and provide services to us, like Amazon for storage and Mixpanel for analytics. Those business partners will be given limited access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide Mikey.

<b>Compliance with the Law:</b> We may disclose your information if we believe it’s necessary in order to comply with the law, such as to comply with a subpoena, regulation or legal request, respond to a government request, to address fraud or security issues, to protect the safety of any person, or to protect our own rights or property.

<b>Business Transfers:</b> If Sidekick Labs is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. The assurances in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information if/when it’s transferred to a new entity. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

<b>Anonymized Information:</b> Should we need to share data about our usage with third parties (such as investors or partners), we will aggregate it and strip it of all personally identifiable information.

<h2>Security</h2>
Security is extremely important to us. We use industry leading security practices to preserve the integrity of all your Mikey data. For example, when you transmit sensitive information and when you send and receive emails, Mikey encrypts the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security. Sidekick Labs is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party. If you have questions about this feel free to contact us at privacy@mikeyteam.com.

Your information collected through Mikey may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates operate. In order to provide the service to you, we may transfer personal information to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which we or our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

In the event that any information is compromised as a result of a breach of security under our control, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and notify those individuals affected.

<h2>Children</h2>
Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@mikeyteam.com.

<h2>Links to other Services/Sites</h2>
Sometimes, links to other websites or services will appear in Mikey, like in emails you receive from third parties.  You agree we don’t have any control over third-party sites or services, we are not responsible for them, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to them.

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect the changes in our business and practices, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the policy in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page, post a notice to the Mikey website or mobile app, or reach out to you via email. By continuing to use Mikey, you agree to be bound by the most recent version of the Privacy Policy. The most up-to-date version can always be found at meetmikey.com/privacy.html.</p>
