<h1 class="page-title">Terms of Service</h1>


<h2>Meet Mikey</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) explain how you can use the Mikey browser extension, website, services and software (collectively “Mikey”), provided by Sidekick Labs, Inc., (“Sidekick Labs,” “we” or “our”) so please read these Terms before you get started. They apply to all visitors, users and others who access Mikey (“users”).</p>
<p>By using Mikey you agree to be bound by these Terms and to the collection and use of your information as spelled out in our Privacy Policy. If you are using Mikey on behalf of a group or organization, you agree to these Terms for that group or organization and represent that you have the authority to do so (in that case, “you” and “your” refers to that group or organization).</p>

<h2>Using Mikey</h2>
<p>Mikey is an app that helps you search, browse and manage the information in your Gmail account. When you add your Gmail account, you authorize Mikey to securely access your messages and attachments using an authentication method called OAuth. Your passwords are never stored on our servers. Our servers securely store a subset of your messages as well as your attachments: this lets us give you the fastest possible access to your content including your files, links, images and messages. Of course, you retain any ownership and intellectual property rights you have in the content in your email (see the Copyright section of these Terms for more detail).</p>

<p>When signing up for Mikey, you agree to provide accurate information. You also understand that you’re responsible for the activity in your Mikey content and for safeguarding any passwords that you use. This goes without saying, but you‘re not allowed to access another user’s account without permission.</p> 

<p>Lots of people rely on Mikey and we trust you to use Mikey responsibly - which means, for example, you agree not to interfere with Mikey or our services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide.</p>

<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy, distribute, or disclose any part of Mikey in any medium,</li>
<li>probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network;</li>
<li>breach or otherwise circumvent any security or authentication measures;</li>
<li>interfere with or disrupt any user, host, or network, for example: don’t send a virus, overload, spam, or mail-bomb any part of Mikey;</li>
<li>plant malware or otherwise use Mikey to distribute malware;</li>
<li>send unsolicited communications, promotions or advertisements, or spam;</li>
<li>send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information, including “spoofing” or “phishing”;</li>
<li>publish anything that is fraudulent, misleading, or infringes another's rights;</li>
<li>impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity;</li>
<li>violate the law in any way, or to violate the privacy of others, or to defame others. </li>
</ul>

<p>We may permanently or temporarily revoke or suspend your access to Mikey without notice and liability for any reason including your violation of these Terms. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by these Terms.</p>

<h2>Who can use Mikey?</h2>
You can use Mikey only if you can form a binding contract with us, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. Use of Mikey by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited.

<h2>Your stuff is your stuff.</h2>
By using Mikey, you allow Mikey to help manage content, information, emails, and attachments and links in those emails (anything you upload, submit, or transmit through Mikey, collectively “your stuff”). You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in your stuff. So, what belongs to you remains yours - we don’t own it. These Terms do not give us any rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the rights we need to provide Mikey to you, as explained in these Terms. You are responsible and liable for anything you copy, share, upload, download, attach, send, receive, record or otherwise do while using Mikey, and you represent that your stuff is actually your stuff or that you have all necessary rights to use your stuff on or through Mikey.
Mikey allows you to connect your email account so we can index and sort your stuff on your behalf. Our servers securely store a limited amount of email as well as the contained attachments so that Mikey can allow you to quickly search, browse and manage your stuff as well as provide you access to the rest of the Mikey functionality. By using Mikey, you give Sidekick Labs permission to do things you ask it to do with your stuff, for example, hosting or searching your stuff as you direct it to through Mikey. This includes sending stuff and providing previews to documents and images. It also includes creating backups of your stuff to ensure it is safe and always accessible to you. By using Mikey, you give Sidekick Labs the permissions needed to provide its services to you through Mikey, including extending that permission to trusted third parties that help us to run Mikey (like Amazon, which hosts our servers). This and other rare exceptions are outlined in our Privacy Policy , which explains exactly how Mikey collects and uses your information generally.

<h2>Our stuff is our stuff.</h2>
<p>We retain our rights title and interest in Mikey, and all that makes up mikey, including, without limitation, software, design, text, graphics, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights (“our stuff”), and all intellectual property rights related to our stuff. Subject to these Terms, we give you a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use Mikey for your personal, noncommercial use only (aka you can’t resell Mikey). Just like you retain ownership over your stuff, we reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms in Mikey and our stuff. These Terms do not provide you with any rights to use our trademarks, logos, domain names, or other brand features. Use of our stuff for any purpose not expressly permitted by these Terms is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>You may choose to give us feedback or ideas about Mikey, including improvements (“ideas”). By submitting an idea, you agree that you’re doing it out of the goodness of your heart and not for financial gain or other recognition. We are free to use the idea or share it with others, or we may use a similar idea, developed by our employees or obtained from another source.</p>

<h2>Copyright</h2>
<p>You are responsible and liable for your stuff and what you otherwise copy, share, upload, download, attach, send, receive, record or otherwise use while using Mikey.</p>
<p>We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Such notices should be reported as outlined in our DMCA Policy. We reserve the right to suspend your account, delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and/or terminate the account of a repeat infringer.</p>

<h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
<p>Your privacy is extremely important to us - we care about the integrity and security of your personal information. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk. Please review our Privacy Policy, which explains exactly how we collect and store your stuff.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Software from Sidekick Labs: Some use of Mikey requires you to download a client software package (“the extension”). To use the extension you must have a device that is compatible, so we cannot guarantee that the app will work on your device. We grant you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the app, solely to access Mikey. Your license to use the app is automatically revoked if you violate these Terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of Mikey or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software (unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission or delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the app).</p>

<h2>Modifying and Terminating Use of Mikey</h2>
<p>We are constantly changing and improving Mikey. We may add or remove features, and while we’ll do our best to give you advance notice about any major changes, you understand that we may stop, suspend, or change Mikey at any time without prior notice. We may also remove content from Mikey at our discretion.</p>

<h2>Indemnity</h2>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Sidekick Labs and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to Mikey, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy or intellectual property rights; (iv) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (v) any claim or damages that arise as a result of any of your stuff or any that is submitted via your account; or (vi) any other party’s access and use of Mikey with your Google account(s) or other appropriate security code(s).</p>

<h2>No Warranty</h2>
<p>We promise to provide you with a great service, but we can’t promise everything. Mikey is provided on an “as-is” and “as available” basis. Use of Mikey and the software is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Mikey and the software is provided without warranties of any kind, whether expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Without limiting the foregoing, Sidekick Labs and its licensors, do not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable or correct; that Mikey or the software will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that Mikey or the software is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of Mikey is downloaded at your own risk and you will be solely responsibly for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from such download or use of the service.</p>

<h2>Liability for Mikey</h2>
<p>When permitted by law, Sidekick Labs and Sidekick Labs’ suppliers and distributors will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages.</p>

<p>To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Sidekick Labs and ts supplier and distributors, for any claim under these terms including for any implied warranty is limited to the amount you paid us to use these services (or if we choose, to supplying you the services again).</p>

<p>In all cases, Sidekick Labs, and its suppliers and distributors will not be liable for any loss or damage.</p>

<p>Mikey is controlled and operated from facilities in the United States. Sidekick Labs makes no representations that Mikey is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use Mikey from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations.</p>

<h2>Business uses of Mikey</h2>
<p>If you are using Mikey on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Sidekick Labs and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>

<h2>About these Terms</h2>
<p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to Mikey, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to Mikey. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. Changes will not apply retroactively. Changes addressing new functions for Mikey or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for Mikey, you should discontinue your use of Mikey.</p>

<p>The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Mikey consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>

<h2>Account Security</h2>
<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the Google account that you use to access Mikey and you agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You are responsible for any activity using your account, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify Sidekick Labs of any unauthorized use of your account.</p> 

<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>Though we’d much rather you stay, you can stop using Mikey at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or end service at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use if you are not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in any way that would cause us legal liability or disrupt others’ use of the Services. If we suspend or terminate your use, we will try to let you know in advance, though there may be some cases (for example, repeatedly or flagrantly violating these Terms, a court order, or danger to other users) where we may suspend immediately.</p>
